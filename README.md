Image2Base64
===========================
Now supports 2 and 3 version of [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)

## About
This is a Sublime Text plugin allowing you to open images as converted to base64.

## Usage
Press <kbd>Ctrl+i+b</kbd> (hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and consequently press <kbd>i</kbd> and <kbd>b</kbd>), like ***i***mage->***b***ase64. Then select image to be copied to clipboard as base64 code.

Also if you use Sublime Text 2 you can just click on image file in sidebar or open it and it will be opened as base64 code.


## Install
### Package Controll

The easiest way to install this is with [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime\_packages/package\_control).

 * If you just went and installed Package Control, you probably need to restart Sublime Text before doing this next bit.
 * Bring up the Command Palette (Command+Shift+p on OS X, Control+Shift+p on Linux/Windows).
 * Select "Package Control: Install Package" (it'll take a few seconds)
 * Select Image2Base64 when the list appears.

Package Control will automatically keep Git up to date with the latest version.

### Alternative
Create plugin folder in Sublime's user packages directory and copy all plugin files there. Then restart Sublime Text.
